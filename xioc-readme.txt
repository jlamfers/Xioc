Xioc is an IOC tool that has been developed by following requirements:

- Keep it easy: small code base (less than 2000 lines of code reported by Code Metric Results), transparent understandable architecture
- focus on functionality, usability, defacto standards
- good (above average) performance, avoid premature optimization, no focus on best-performance-ever-with-specific-context
- still custruction is optimized with compiled delegates 
- scope based (using scopes is required to be able to resolve instances)
- simple lifestyle support : transient/transientNoDispose, perScope, perContainer, Unmanaged
- fool proof usage => you may not be able to register "wrong" bindings. Each binding must be managed.
- thread safe (under all circumstances)
- easy integration with WCF, MVC5, WebApi2
- supports auto wiring
- supports constructor injection
- supports property injection (optionally, disabled by default)
- supports MEF annotations (optionally, disabled by default)
- supports multi binding
- supports enumerable, list, collection, and lazy injection
- supports in-code configuration
- supports xml-configuration (optionally, easy to extend/customize)
- supports decorators
- supports interception (using Microsoft's RealProxy )
- supports scoped bindings (optionally, additional (conditional) bindings/decorators/interceptors on scope construction, controlled by scope depth and any other custom condition)
- supports async fire-and-forget executions, scope lifetime will depend on async executions lifetime, if any (queued dispose)
- supports custom dependencies
- supports custom factories
- supports context awareness
- supports generics
- supports recursion detection
- supports methods ResolveScoped/ReleaseScoped, i.e., you may resolve an instance managed by an isolated scope, which is disposed by method ReleaseScoped(resolvedInstance)
- lack of registration keys
- no custom life styles, focus on scope
- disposable tracking by default => created by xioc, then disposed by xioc
- optionally supports memory overflow protection (protected by garbage collector/weak reference disposable storage)
